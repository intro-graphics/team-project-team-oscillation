### Project Introduction

In our project, we built a simple escape room. Users need to find the correct password to finish the game. Users will get the clues by looking at the poster and the pattern on the window as well as hanging four different weights on the spring.

### Advance features

1. Mouse picking

2. Physics based simulation   
(i) Modeling the spring  
The spring shape is modeled as the surface generated by a circle sweeping around the z-axis in the path of a helix. So the Spring class is modified from the existing Grid patch class and the Surface of revolution class from Tiny graphics. The spring mass system is based on the equation F = -kx-cv = ma where c is the damping constant.

(ii) Cloth modeling    
We simulate cloth using particles. These particles are point masses. We model the deformation of cloth as particles held together by springs. The forces on each particle involve contributions due to pairwise interactions with some other particles close to it.  The particles are also subject to external forces, gravity and wind force. The force obeys Hookeâ€™s law with a damping term.
